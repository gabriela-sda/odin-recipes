    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pork scallopini is a dish made from thinly sliced pork cutlets that are typically dredged in flour, saut√©ed until golden brown, and then simmered in a flavorful sauce. The sauce often includes ingredients like lemon juice, white wine, butter, and capers, giving it a rich and tangy flavor.</p>
    <p>Is a classic Italian dish, known for its simplicity and versatility. The term scallopini refers to thin, boneless cuts of meat, which can include pork, veal, or chicken, that are pounded flat to ensure even cooking. The thinness of the meat allows it to cook quickly, making it perfect for a fast meal that doesn't skimp on flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (4-ounce) boneless lean pork loin chops (about 1/2-inch thick)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped shallot</li>
        <li>1 large garlic clove, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 small lemon, thinly sliced and seeded</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons drained non-pareil capers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place pork chops between 2 sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap. Pound with a meat mallet to 1/4-inch thickness. Sprinkle pork evenly with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place flour in a shallow dish; dredge seasoned cutlets in flour, and shake off excess. Heat 1 tablespoon each of the butter and the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high until butter foam subsides. Add 2 pork cutlets, and cook until golden on bottom, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Transfer cutlets to a large plate; wipe out skillet. Repeat cooking process with 1 tablespoon of the butter, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and remaining 2 cutlets. Wipe out skillet.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in skillet over medium. Add shallot and garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and garlic just starts to brown, about 1 minute. Add wine, and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost evaporated, about 1 minute. Add broth and lemon slices, and bring to a boil over medium; cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in capers. Reduce heat to low, and whisk in remaining 5 tablespoons butter, 1 to 2 pieces at a time, until melted and sauce is creamy, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer cutlets to plates, and spoon sauce evenly over top. Sprinkle evenly with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
